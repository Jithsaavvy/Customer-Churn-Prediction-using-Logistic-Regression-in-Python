# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression-in-Python

In this, I developed a classifier that predicts  which customer will leave a particular company or stays with the company which is simply referred as **Churns** from the given customer dataset.

This is implemeted in Python by using Scikit-learn[sklearn], Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn 

Logistic Regression is a variant of Linear Regression, and it is used when the dependent variable - 'y' is categorical or discrete. It predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.

Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve called **Logistic Curve or Sigmoid Curve** by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the function called sigmoid function ùúé
